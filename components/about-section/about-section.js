                Curious by nature, constantly looking for the next problem to solve.
                My passions include computer science, design and carbonara.
                I'm a firm believer in the formula "1+1=3".

                What moves me is helping people, I try to make a positive impact on the world. When I wrote my first line of code I knew that computer science would be the tool to accomplish that.
